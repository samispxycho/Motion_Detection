# Motion_Detection
This project of motion and body movement detection is created using Python, OpenCV, and MediaPipe Holistic. This advanced technology enables real-time tracking and analysis of human body movements. When motion is detected, the system emits a distinct beep sound, alerting users to any activity. Additionally, the areas of motion are dynamically highlighted on the screen, offering visual feedback and enhancing user interaction. This project finds applications in fitness monitoring, gesture recognition, and interactive user interfaces, making it a valuable and versatile tool for various domains.
